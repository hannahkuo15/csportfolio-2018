    <h1> WEBSITE HOW TO PAGE</h1>
    <h2> - Creation - </h2>
        <p> During this Expeditions round, I created an interactive website in the form of a quiz. This quiz tests the user on their knowledge of the book <em> Wildfire's Twin </em>.</em></p>
        <img src="img/quiz.png" height="200px"/>
        <a href="https://preview.c9users.io/hkuo/csportfolio/website.html?_c9_id=livepreview3&_c9_host=https://ide.c9.io"> Here is the quiz! </a>
        <p> This project works great overall. There is a list of ten questions  and the "See Scores" button will tell you whether or not you answered each question correctly. </p>
    <h2> - Specifics of the Code - </h2>
        <p> There were certain specifics of the code that I learned about, had to figure out how to use, or just refresh my memory on the way they work. Such examples of these are 'addEventListener', 'button', 'getElementbyId', and more. </p>
    <h3> -addEventListener- </h3>
        <img src="img/eventlistener.png" /> 
        <p> Event Listeners give an element something to 'listen' for (such as a mouse click, or a key being pressed) and then a function to perform when that event occurs. In this image, the event listener tells the element "scoresButton" to listen for the "click" event to happen. When it does, it will run the functions in the code block below. In my project, after the button is clicked, it will run through all the if-else statements and check each question to see which one it should mark as 'correct' and 'try again'. </p>
    <h3> -Button- </h3>
        <img src="img/button.png" />
        <img src="img/buttoncss.png" />
        <img src="img/scoresbutton.png" />
        <p> Creating a button was one of the things I had learned how to code. I learned how to give it a class and an ID as well. The label this button displays is "See Scores", which tells the user "Click on this button if you want to see the scores you got for this quiz!" As you can see, this button is different than the classic HTML button that is usually used. I was searching up different ways to customize an HTML button, when I came across instructions on how to code a CSS button, which I liked much more than the usual buttons I used. I kept the CSS button and used it in my website instead of the HTML one.</p>
    <h3> -getElementById- </h3>
        <img src="img/getelement.png" />
        <p> Getting elements by their ID was a huge part of this project. I learned how to create a descriptive variable, then use 'getElementById' to bring all the HTML coding about that particular element and place it into the variable. In doing so, we are able to make these elements "move", or assign them events to listen for, and et cetera. </p>
    <h3> -Conditionals- </h3>
        <img src="img/if-else.png" />
        <p> Conditionals were something I learned from the past project. This element was an essential part of this project because it gave the user their scores for each question in the quiz. The if statement points out a specific answer in the question to mark as 'correct'. The else statement returns a 'try again' string if the user did not select the right answer, or didn't answer the question at all. </p>   
    <h3> -Input- </h3>
        <img src="img/input.png" />
        <p> I had to search up how to code the quiz itself. I had planned to make the format a little bit different, but I realized that was a bit too complicated for me, so I decided to display all the questions on one page. These inputs and bulleted lists create the multi-choice questions the quiz has. They each have a distinct ID based on the question they are under and which answer choice they are. The labels of each input are the answer choices the user will see. The divs at the end of each bulleted list is the place where the words 'Correct!' or 'Try again' will show up, based on their selected answers. </p>
    <h2> - Choices - </h3>
        <p> Some choices I had to make were whether or not to create a quiz as my interactive website and whether to change the design I wanted for this quiz or not. I had wanted to expand on my info page in the previous checkpoint originally, since I understood a lot of the concepts I needed to use, and I had fun doing it. However, the info page I was creating already exists elsewhere, and one of the requirements of this project was to create a website that would be the solution to a specific 'problem'. So Mr. Hesby suggested I create a quiz. I started to create my quiz when I realized again, 'A quiz just like this already exists. I need a new topic to quiz my users on'. So I changed the topic of the quiz from <em> Keeper of the Lost Cities </em> by Shannon Messenger to <em> Wilfire's Twin</em>, a book I wrote. It had just been published last year, and not too many people know of this yet, so I knew there wasn't a quiz for this. I had originally wanted the format of my quiz to display one question and its answers one by one on the page. However, as I tried to figure this out, it proved to be a bit too difficult for me to figure out in the amount of time I had for this project, so I decided to display all the questions on one page instead.</p>
    <h2> - Connections - </h3> 
        <p> This project helped me to understand more of how HTML and JavaScript work together to create something. I had always thought that these two programs were very different and very independent of each other, other than the fact that JavaScript needed HTML to run. However, through this project, I realized that HTML was the one that created the elements and designed them through CSS while JavaScript took those elements and made them more interactive and gave them commands. This was very eye-opening for me, and I was very excited throughout this whole project because I was constantly learning more about interactions between HTML and JavaScript.</p>
    <h2> - Conclusion - </h3>    
        <p> I enjoyed working on this project overall. I learned many things through this class and this project, and I would like to create more websites and play with elements and commands in my free time. If I had more time for this project, I would find a way to decorate my page more. There aren't many pictures I can use for this project, so I only have one image, but I would use my extra time to learn a bit more about CSS and all the limitations CSS has so I will know what it wouldn't cover, and figure out a way to do it myself. </p>
